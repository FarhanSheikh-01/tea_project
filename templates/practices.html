    <!-- Best Practices for Tea Plantation -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Best Practices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Soil Preparation:</b> Ensure that the soil is well-drained, rich in organic matter, and has a pH of 4.5-5.5, ideal for tea plants.</li>
        <li><b>Proper Spacing:</b> Maintain a proper distance between tea plants to ensure healthy growth and reduce competition for nutrients.</li>
        <li><b>Water Management:</b> Provide adequate irrigation to maintain consistent moisture levels, especially during dry periods.</li>
        <li><b>Pruning and Maintenance:</b> Regular pruning is essential to maintain plant health, promote new growth, and enhance tea leaf production.</li>
        <li><b>Pest and Disease Management:</b> Use integrated pest management (IPM) techniques, combining biological, cultural, and chemical methods to control pests and diseases.</li>
        <li><b>Harvesting:</b> Harvest tea leaves selectively, picking the tender young leaves at the right stage for optimal flavor and quality.</li>
      </ul>
